# PSY6422 Replication Project 

## Data Analysis & Visualisation 
This page contains the workflow, functions, analysis, and outputs for my project completed as part of PSY6422: Data Analysis & Visualisation at the University of Sheffield.
The work investigates replication outcomes and effect sizes in science using the FReD dataset (replication database) 

Live website: https://willrowe12345.github.io/PSY6422-Replication-Project/ 

## Folder summary: 
* markdown.qmd - main analysis and report 
* docs/ – rendered website files for GitHub Pages 
* R/ – helper functions and themes 
* figures/ – saved plots used in the report 
* materials/ – codebook 

## Other files:
renv.lock – ensures reproducible R package versions

### Reproducible 
The project used "renv" for reproducibility.
To install the correct package version use:

install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()

The original data set can be found here. https://willrowe12345.github.io/PSY6422-Replication-Project/, which is linked from the FORRT replication hub:https://forrt.org/replication-hub/
